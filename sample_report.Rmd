## **Results**

**Detection p value** `r qc_pval`

- This is the average probability of proper signature detection. A value > 0.05 indicates poor sample quality

**5-year methylome probability:** `r metp`

- This is the probability of 5-year recurrence using a methylome signature derived from the tumour

**5-year Meningioma Recurrence Score:** `r recurrence_score`

- This is the probability of 5-year recurrence-free survival calculated using a nomogram that incorporated the 5-year methylome probability with established clinical prognostic factors (WHO grade and Simpson grade) if provided by the user
